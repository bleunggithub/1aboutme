# About Me Website v1.0

* This is a static website made as the **first project** of the Xccelerate full-stack web development bootcamp in **August 2020**.
* The site uses mainly HTML, CSS for styling and little javascript for some fun features (e.g. mouseover to change to a random image)
* Please click [here](https://bleungaboutmev1.surge.sh) to see the website
