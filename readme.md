# About Me Website v1.0

* This is a static website made as the **first project** of the Xccelerate full-stack web development bootcamp in **August 2020**.
* The site is built on mainly HTML and CSS, with a little javascript for some fun features (e.g. mouseover to change to a random image)
* Please click <a href="https://bleungaboutmev1.surge.sh"  target="_blank">here</a> to see the website 
* Or the youtube video below to see how it works
